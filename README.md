# BeatEmAll by Nicolas Debeurme and Paul Snauwaert

This project was conducted during October 2021 with no clear instructions except for the fact that we had to make a functional game that had a menu with transitions between scenes, a gaming scene and a game over scene.

We decided to develop a "Beat them All" kind of game in the style of a FPS Survival Game with rounds. Enemies spawn regularly in spawnpoints and track down the player to kill him. The player is given a AR and has to survive couple rounds to win, or die trying to do so.

We decided to split up tasks such that :
- Paul Snauwaert was in charge of the menu and its different tabs. He implemented a video background, smooth transitions between actions and functional features such as volume regulation or window scaling.
- Nicolas Debeurme was in charge of the game scene. He implemented the playable character and imported numerous assets to create the environment and the enemies. He is also behind the main game program (defining enemy actions, rounds, player actions...)

We are overall satisfied with how the project was conducted. We had about 20 hours to develop this and were at a early stage of C#/Unity courses. 
As a result, this project defenitely helped us gain experience in a practical way.
